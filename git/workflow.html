      <h2>Understanding the Git Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        Git helps track changes in your code. Understanding its workflow is
        crucial for using Git effectively. Below is the basic workflow you'll
        follow when working with Git.

      <h3>Git Terminologies and Workflow Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Before explaining the workflow, I recommend familiarizing yourself with
        some basic terminologies and their relationships. Below are brief
        explanations and illustrations of these concepts. While they may not be
        strictly accurate in every technical sense, they will help you grasp the
        Git workflow in the beginning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Repository</strong>: A place to store source code/projects,
          including all approved versions. There are two types of repositories:
          remote and local.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Working Directory</strong>: A local area where you edit your
          source code/projects. It always contains the latest version, and no
          approval is needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staging Area (Index)</strong>: A temporary area where source
          code/projects are stored before approval.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staging</strong>: The process of moving a file from the
          working directory to the staging area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commit</strong>: The process of approving and saving changes
          from the staging area to the local repository. After committing, the
          staging area is cleared.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Synchronize</strong>: The process of updating the remote
          repository with the latest version from the local repository.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Example1">First Example: Git Environment with VSCode</h2>
      <p>
        This first example of a Git workflow consists of the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a repository on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Clone the remote repository to your working directory.</li>
        <li>Freely create/edit files inside your working directory.</li>
        <li>After making some edits, stage the changes and commit them.</li>
        <li>
          Synchronize your changes with the remote repository. Then return to
          step 3.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This approach requires only a few commands, making it beginner-friendly.
        It's the best starting point to explore the world of Git. Let's break
        down the process.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Create a repository on GitHub</h3>
      Go to GitHub and log into your account. Once logged in, click the + sign
      in the top-right corner and select <b>New repository</b>. (You can also
      create a new repository from the "Repositories" tab.)
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_1.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 60%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      Do the following setup:
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a name for your repository, such as my-first-repo.</li>
        <li>
          Leave the description field empty for now, but it's always helpful to
          add one later to explain what your project is about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toggle the repository type to Private.
          <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
          <a
            href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation1')"
            >[What is Public?]</a
          >

          <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
          <div
            id="explanation1"
            style="
              display: none;
              margin-top: 10px;
              font-size: 0.9em;
              color: #555;
            "
          >
            <p>
              "Public" means anyone can view your code, so avoid including
              sensitive or private information. In the future, you can adjust
              this setting according to your needs.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Check the box to Initialize this repository with a README to add a
          basic file that explains your project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave the .gitignore and license options set to None.
          <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
          <a
            href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation2')"
            >[What is them?]</a
          >

          <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
          <div
            id="explanation2"
            style="
              display: none;
              margin-top: 10px;
              font-size: 0.9em;
              color: #555;
            "
          >
            <ul>
              <li>
                A .gitignore file specifies which files should be excluded from
                version control. This is useful for automatically generated
                files, compiled outputs, or private configuration files. You can
                add a .gitignore file manually at any time, but it's an advanced
                setting.
              </li>
              <li>
                A license defines how others can use your repository. For
                example, the MIT License allows free use with minimal
                restrictions. This is an advanced topic, as understanding the
                details of a license requires some legal knowledge. If you're
                interested, take some time to research licenses before making
                your repository public. It's not essential for beginners, but
                it's good to understand the basics as you grow in your coding
                journey.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      After configuring these settings, click <b>Create repository</b>. Then,
      you can move to the step to clone repository.

      <h3>2. Clone the remote repository to your working directory</h3>
      <p>
        The next step is to bring the new repository to your local machine so
        you can work on it. This is called "<b>cloning</b>" the repository.
      </p>

      On the repository page on GitHub, click the green <b>Code</b> button, then
      copy the URL under Clone with HTTPS. (You can also clone using SSH if you
      have set up SSH authentication.)
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_2.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 50%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Open Git Bash. Change your current directory to the place where you want
        to save the repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, type the following command. Since you have already copied the
        repository URL, you can paste it after <code>git clone</code>:
      </p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-repo.git</pre>
      </div>
      <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation5')"
        >[What does this command do?]</a
      >

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation5"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <p>
          The <code>git clone</code> command copies the specified repository (in
          this case, from GitHub) to your local machine. Git automatically sets
          up everything, so this is the only command needed for cloning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Finally, navigate to the newly created repository folder and open it in
        VSCode. The following code helps you to do this process:
      </p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
cd my-first-repo
code .</pre
        >
      </div>
      <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation3')"
        >[What does this command do?]</a
      >

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation3"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <code>cd [directory]</code> command changes the current
            directory to the specified location. This exapmle is supposed to set
            the project name as my-first-repo.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>code .</code> command opens VSCode in the current
            directory.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Tip:</b> You can use Git Bash as a terminal inside VSCode, which is
        useful for executing Git commands.
        <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
        <a
          href="javascript:void(0);"
          onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation4')"
          >[How to open it?]</a
        >
      </p>

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation4"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <ol>
          <li>Open VSCode and go to View → Terminal.</li>
          <li>
            If the default terminal is not Bash, click the + button in the
            terminal panel and select <b>Bash</b>.
            <figure style="text-align: center">
              <img
                src="img/git_exam1_3.png"
                alt="Create a new repository"
                style="max-width: 40%; height: auto"
              />
            </figure>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Freely create/edit files inside your working directory</h3>
      You can now create or edit files freely. In the example below, we created
      two text files: test1.txt and test2.txt inside the working directory.
      Don't forget to save your files before moving to the next step.
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_4.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 50%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>

      <h3>4. After making some edits, stage the changes and commit them</h3>

      Open the Source Control panel in VSCode by clicking the Source Control
      icon in the left sidebar.
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_5.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      Click the <b>Stage All Changes</b> button to add all modified files to the
      staging area. This button appears when you hover over the
      <b>Changes</b> section. See the following image for details:
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_6.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        You can also stage files individually by clicking the + icon next to
        each file name.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Before clicking the Commit</b> button, be sure to enter a commit
        message describing your changes, such as 'Version 1.1' or a brief
        summary of the modifications. (If you accidentally click the button
        without adding a message, you can write one in the newly opened tab and
        then close it.)
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_7.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, click <b>blue Commit button</b>.</p>
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_8.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>

      <h3>5. Synchronize your changes with the remote repository</h3>
      After committing your changes, the <b>blue Commit button</b> will change
      to a <b>blue Sync button</b>. Click the Sync button to push your changes
      to the remote repository.
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_9.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      To confirm that your changes were successfully updated, check your
      repository on GitHub.

      <h2 id="Example2">
        Second Example: Git Environment with VSCode without remote repository
      </h2>
      <p>
        This example demonstrates how to set up a Git environment without a
        remote repository. Some developers want to use Git for version control
        without uploading their code to GitHub. This could be due to security
        policies that prohibit internet access or simply because the project is
        too small to require remote management. In such cases, we cannot use
        GitHub, so we need to set up Git locally. Before starting, it's helpful
        to know how to open Bash in VSCode.
        <a
          href="javascript:void(0);"
          onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation6')"
          >[How to open it?]</a
        >
      </p>

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation6"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <ol>
          <li>Open VSCode and go to View → Terminal.</li>
          <li>
            If the default terminal is not Bash, click the + button in the
            terminal panel and select <b>Bash</b>.
            <figure style="text-align: center">
              <img
                src="img/git_exam1_3.png"
                alt="Create a new repository"
                style="max-width: 40%; height: auto"
              />
            </figure>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>This example follows these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create or choose a working directory that is not yet set up with Git.
        </li>
        <li>Run the command <code>git init</code>.</li>
        <li>Edit your files and write code as needed.</li>
        <li>
          Stage and commit your changes. Then, repeat from step 3 as needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let's break down the process.</p>

      <h3>1. Create or Choose a Working Directory</h3>
      <p>
        First, decide where you want to store your project. You can create a new
        folder or use an existing one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open a Bash terminal in VSCode, then navigate to the directory you want
        to use as your working directory. Use the following command to navigate
        to your chosen directory:
      </p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>cd path/to/your/project</pre>
      </div>
      <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation7')"
        >[What does this command do?]</a
      >

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation7"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <p>
          The <code>cd [directory]</code> command changes the current directory
          to the specified location. Please change the path to your working
          directory.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Initialize a Git Repository</h3>
      <p>To initialize Git in this directory, run:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
git init
code .</pre
        >
      </div>
      <!-- Link to toggle explanation -->
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleExplanation('explanation8')"
        >[What does this command do?]</a
      >

      <!-- Explanation block (hidden by default) -->
      <div
        id="explanation8"
        style="display: none; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555"
      >
        <ul>
          <li>
            This initializes a hidden .git folder inside your project, which
            stores all version history and Git settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>code .</code> command opens VSCode in the current
            directory with Git enabled.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Edit and Modify Files</h3>
      Now you can create or edit files in your project as needed. In the example
      below, we created two text files: test1.txt and test2.txt inside the
      working directory.
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_10.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 50%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      Don't forget to save your files before moving to the next step.

      <h3>4. Stage and Commit Changes</h3>

      Open the Source Control panel in VSCode by clicking the Source Control
      icon in the left sidebar.
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_11.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      Click the <b>Stage All Changes</b> button to add all modified files to the
      staging area. This button appears when you hover over the
      <b>Changes</b> section. See the following image for details:
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_12.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        You can also stage files individually by clicking the + icon next to
        each file name.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Before clicking the Commit</b> button, be sure to enter a commit
        message describing your changes, such as 'Version 1.1' or a brief
        summary of the modifications. (If you accidentally click the button
        without adding a message, you can write one in the newly opened tab and
        then close it.)
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_13.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, click <b>blue Commit button</b>.</p>
      <figure style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/git_exam1_14.png"
          alt="Create a new repository"
          style="max-width: 35%; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      The <b>blue Commit button</b> changes to
      <b>blue Publish Branch button</b>, but no need to click. Go back to step 3
      and continue coding.

        Third Example: How to Link a Local Git Repository to GitHub with VSCode
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the second example, we added Git to an existing local project. In
        this final example, we will show you how to connect a local Git
        repository to GitHub. If you use VSCode, the process is quite simple.
      </p>
      <p>This can be achieved by following these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Initialize Git for the project if you haven’t already (follow the
          steps in Example 2).
        </li>
        <li>Open the project in VSCode (with Git enabled).</li>
        <li>
          Click the <b>blue Publish Branch</b> button and follow the prompts.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once these steps are completed, your project will be successfully linked
        to GitHub, and you can manage it as shown in Example 1.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The examples above cover the basic fundamentals of using Git and GitHub.
        Since I demonstrated the process using VSCode, most of the commands are
        simplified and hidden behind the VSCode UI. However, you can accomplish
        the same tasks using the command line without relying on any UI. This
        means you can use any text editor, such as Emacs, to manage your Git
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I haven't covered some important concepts like
        <b>branching</b> and <b>merging</b>, which are essential features of Git
        and GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next section, we will translate each UI operation into its
        corresponding command-line operation.
