        <h2>Welcome to the C# Guide</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to assist developers transitioning from Visual Studio to VSCode.  
          Hence, this is <b>NOT</b> intended for absolute beginners in C# syntax.  
          Instead, it focuses solely on improving the C# development experience in VSCode.
        </p>
        <p>If there are no restrictions preventing you from using Visual Studio, I strongly recommend developing in it.  
           Visual Studio is highly optimized for C# development, especially for Windows Forms applications.
        </p>
        <p>This site is targeted at developers who either cannot or choose not to use Visual Studio for reasons such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual Studio is too resource-intensive for your PC (e.g., limited memory, storage, or processing power).</li>
          <li>You are a Mac/Linux user, and there is no fully supported version of Visual Studio available.</li>
          <li>You require <b><u>commercial use</u></b> of C# but cannot use Visual Studio due to its licensing terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This guide aims to help users, particularly those needing a commercial-friendly setup, to develop in C# without incurring extra licensing costs.
        </p>

      <h2>Development Environment</h2>
      <p>To support commercial use and efficient development, this guide is based on the following setup:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Development on Windows 11.</li>
          <li>Using VSCode as the primary IDE.</li>
          <li><b><u>Not using C# Dev Kit</u></b> due to its licensing terms, which are similar to Visual Studio.</li>
          <li>Using only extensions licensed under MIT or similarly permissive licenses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This site does not guarantee the accuracy of licensing information and assumes no responsibility for any licensing issues.  
        Licenses may change over time, and it is each user's responsibility to verify the latest terms.</p>

            <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
            <p>Follow these sections to set up and develop C# projects in VSCode:</p>
            
            <h3><a href="setup.html">1. Setting Up C#</a></h3>
            <p>Learn how to install and configure a C# development environment in VSCode.  
              Always review the licensing terms to ensure they meet your needs.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="projects.html">2. Creating C# Projects</a></h3>

            <h3><a href="ui-controls.html">4. Working with UI Controls</a></h3>
            <p>Understand how to add UI controls in a Windows Forms project.
