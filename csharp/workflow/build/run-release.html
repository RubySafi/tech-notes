      <h2>Running in Release Mode</h2>
      <p>In this section, we explain how to build and run your program without detailed debugging. 
        This is useful for checking how your program behaves when there are no errors. It allows you to 
        quickly view the current UI or verify that a function is working as expected.
        This action corresponds to pressing <code>Ctrl+F5</code> in Visual Studio with the "Release" configuration.
      </p>

      <h3>Command Line Method</h3>
      <p>Run the following command in your terminal:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>  dotnet run --configuration Release</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Other Method</h3>
      <p>Unlike "Run Without Debugging," there is no direct GUI option for running in Release mode. 
        To run your program in Release mode from the menu, you need to modify the `tasks.json` file. 
        After that, you can run it via <strong>Terminal â†’ Run Task</strong>.
        Since this setup is more advanced compared to the command line method, details are omitted here.
        Please search for more information if you're interested.
